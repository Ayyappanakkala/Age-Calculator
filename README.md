## Overview

You can see a live demo of this project [here](https://ayyappanakkala.github.io/Age-Calculator/).

## The Challenge

The primary user stories for this project include:

1. **View Age Calculation:**

   - Users should be able to see their age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form.

2. **Input Validation:**

   - Users should receive validation errors if any of the following conditions are not met:
     - Any field is empty when the form is submitted.
     - The day number is not between 1-31.
     - The month number is not between 1-12.
     - The year is in the future.
     - The date is invalid (e.g., 31/04/1991, considering there are 30 days in April).

3. **Optimal Layout:**

   - Users should see the optimal layout for the interface based on their device's screen size.

4. **Interactive Elements:**

   - Users should experience hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

5. **Bonus - Animated Numbers:**
   - Users should see the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted.
